Enjoy solving problems!

Just like gaming!

## Sorted Array

- Binary Search
- Two Pointers

## Binary Search tree

- converted to sorted array

## Permutations/Subsets

- Backtracking

## Tree

- BFS
- DFS
  - does the tree and its subtree apply the same question pattern?
  - compare tree/subtree -> match string/sub-string

## Graph

- BFS
- DFS

## Linked List

- Two Pointers

## No Recursion

- Stack

## In-place

- Swap
- Store different values in the same pointer

## Top K

- Heap
- QuickSelect

## Common Strings

- Map
- Trie

## General Approach

- Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
- Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
